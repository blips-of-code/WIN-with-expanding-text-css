				<p>The UK’s foreign spy agency is seeking to recruit tech-savvy officers but this does not extend to the later phase of the rigorous selection procedure. The software can be used to improve application forms  — provided that it gives an ‘accurate presentation’ and does not explicitly mention MI6, MI5 or intelligence. However, applicants have to sign a declaration saying they will not use AI in the later online tests, which have to be undertaken ‘without any third-party assistance’.

				<p>Former-British Prime Minister Boris Johnson claimed in his book Unleashed that he discovered a bugging device, used for listening in on private conversations, in his personal bathroom at the Foreign Office after he met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in 2017. Johnson claimed that his security team found the device after Netanyahu had used the bathroom. “...It may or may not be a coincidence but I am told that later, when they were doing a regular sweep for bugs, they found a listening device in the thunderbox (a slang term for bathroom),” Johnson wrote in his book.

					<p>The future was once dazzling for IronNet. Founded by a former director of the National Security Agency and stacked with elite members of the U.S. intelligence establishment, IronNet promised it was going to revolutionize the way governments and corporations combat cyberattacks. Its pitch — combining the prowess of ex-government hackers with cutting-edge software – was initially a hit. Shortly after going public in 2021, the company’s value shot past $3 billion. Yet, as blazing as IronNet started, it burned out. Last September the never-profitable company announced it was shutting down and firing its employees after running out of money, providing yet another example of a tech firm that faltered after failing to deliver on overhyped promises. The firm’s crash has left behind a trail of bitter investors and former employees who remain angry at the company and believe it misled them about its financial health.

					<p>Think of Russia’s most dangerous jobs and the role of research scientist doesn’t immediately spring to mind. Coal miner, maybe. Or a deep-sea diver on the Barents Sea oil rigs. The same kinds of jobs that are dangerous anywhere. But over the past six years, at least a dozen scientists, many of whom conducted research in the field of high-speed aerodynamics or hypersonics, have been arrested. Some of the arrests were on suspicion of handing over scientific data to Moscow’s rivals. The latest was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Several had been detained after participating in research with other countries, with the approval of the Russian state. Some had been working on projects related to the defense sector. Others were involved with basic scientific studies. “Spy mania reigns in Russia right now, a sort of besieged fortress concept,” said Sergei Davidis, who heads the political prisoners support program at Nobel Peace Prize-winning Russian human-rights group Memorial. “There is such hyper-security on the part of the state, hyper-concern that nothing leaks out.” (Full article <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/putin-russia-scientist-arrests-ae6d9ed2?mod=world_feat5_russia_pos1__;!!PvDODwlR4mBZyAb0!U0gT18YlOjfk02x7W-CL81-UnQFCdeNZ48dShqnsVIrcKhVyhtzW1ZYC1j3Ne7GDC-wbkRTTxcq_cl4Uu47WKA$" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>

					<p>The Central Intelligence Agency is boosting its efforts to recruit Chinese citizens as it seeks to capitalize on what US officials say is growing discontent with President Xi Jinping's rule. The agency issued Chinese-language instructions on Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, Telegram, and X on Wednesday, detailing how individuals can securely contact it on its public and dark web sites. "There are plenty of people who have access to information and who are disaffected from the Xi regime in China," CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said in an interview. "You've got people inside who see what's happening, and for lots of different motivations fundamentally do not like the direction that Xi is taking the country and understand that there's a path to helping their own country by working with us," Cohen said.

					<p>David Barnea's image was framed as a “gadget-loving killing machine” long before he was accused by Hezbollah of wounding 3,000-4,000 of its operatives when thousands of their beepers, walkie talkies, and other electronic devices suddenly blew up on September 17-18. Although he only became Mossad chief in June 2021, he was credited by many foreign observers as the architect of the assassination of Iran nuclear chief Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in November 2020 using a “star wars” style long-range remote control gun. The impact of the electronic device explosions on Hezbollah did not just remove many operatives from the battlefield – although that in and of itself was substantial – it also disabled the organization’s national communications and paralyzed their ability to respond for several days. It probably laid the groundwork for the assassination of Radwan special forces Chief Ibrahim Aqil and his sub-commanders, who may have been forced to congregate physically in one spot due to the breakdown in electronic communications. All this created an optimal situation for the IDF to start its mass air strikes, bearing down on Hezbollah with the terror group on its hind legs.

					<p>After weeks of daring Israeli attacks on Iranian proxies in Lebanon and Gaza — and even in Iran itself — comments made recently by the former president of Iran, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, to the effect that Israel’s Mossad intelligence agency managed to infiltrate even the top echelons of Iran’s intelligence services are drawing increased scrutiny. According to a report in the Times of Israel, Mr. Ahmadinejad says an intelligence group tasked primarily with spying on Israel was all-but taken over by Mossad, which managed to recruit the head of the Iranian group — as well as most of his lieutenants — as a double agent. The goal of the Mossad operation, according to Mr. Ahmadinejad, was to steal information about Iran’s nuclear program. Mr. Ahmadinejad — who was barred from running in this year’s special presidential election following the death of President Raisi in a helicopter crash — made the claims during a recent interview with CNN Türk, CNN’s Istanbul-based, Turkish-language affiliate.

					<p>The Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) announces a first-of-its-kind partnership with the University of Virginia (UVA) to establish the National Security Data and Policy Institute (NSDPI) to advance the Intelligence Community’s (IC) use of emerging technologies to collect, analyze, and manage data, a crucial component of the IC’s foreign intelligence mission. The news was shared yesterday in a press release. “This partnership with UVA is a terrific example of how the Intelligence Community can collaborate with academia to increase our understanding of critically important national security issues,” said Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines. “Today, not only is an astounding amount of open-source data available to the public, but various actors, including foreign adversaries, also have access to increasingly advanced analytic tools that rely on, among other things, artificial intelligence, to exploit such information in new ways that exacerbate existing threats such as cybersecurity challenges. Among many benefits, this partnership will help us better identify and leverage open-source data of most value to our national security mission and to produce insights through largely unclassified information. In doing so, we will be better positioned to transparently share our insights with a range of partners, including industry, for purposes of facilitating collaboration on critical national security matters while also engaging in a more sophisticated discussion through which we can learn and grow from our partners’ insights in industry and academia.” (Full article <a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/cybersecurity/odni-establishes-national-security-data-and-policy-institute-in-partnership-with-the-university-of-virginia/__;!!PvDODwlR4mBZyAb0!U0gT18YlOjfk02x7W-CL81-UnQFCdeNZ48dShqnsVIrcKhVyhtzW1ZYC1j3Ne7GDC-wbkRTTxcq_cl6Kg_hyYg$" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>

					<p>South Sudan’s President Salva Kiir has sacked his powerful and long-serving spy chief Gen Akol Koor Kuc. He became head of the feared National Security Services (NSS) after independence in 2011 and continued throughout the bitter civil war that followed. No reason was given in the presidential decree that announced his removal, which was read out on national TV on Wednesday night - but he has been made governor of the president’s home state of Warrup, where insecurity is rife. Analysts say it may signal a power-struggle in Kiir's inner circle - with some believing Gen Kuc may be being lined up to one day take over from the 73-year-old president.

					<p>Even for a Russian spy service official, Sergey Korolev stands out as exceptionally secretive. Korolev, the second-in-command at Russia's Federal Security Service (FSB), has hidden the details of his life and identity so well that even the basics like his birth date and appearance are mixed up or appear to have been invented entirely. This secretiveness may be helping him evade international sanctions. The spy chief, whose agency plays a special role in Russia’s war against Ukraine, is identified inconsistently or incorrectly on numerous international sanctions lists, possibly rendering him at times undetectable to sanctions enforcers. Moreover, the only photo of “Korolev” that appears in many media reports about him pictures a completely different Russian man. The Kyiv Independent has filled in the gaps in the story of Korolev, stripping Vladimir Putin’s deputy spy chief of a significant portion of his long-lived anonymity.

					<p>Washington, D.C. is full of open secrets. You just need to be here long enough to know where to look. And in the stone, brick, and flowered neighborhood of Kalorama, where former President Barack Obama still has a house that the Secret Service guards, there is also a home to China’s diplomats and spies. The residence sits between the chancery of Algeria and a suicide prevention sign, just steps away from the Taft Bridge. There are no plaques or flags denoting its identity or purpose. But observers will notice that it is surrounded by a tall, black fence, with numerous cameras pointing outward and inward. The gated entryway is a little more inviting, with ginkgo leaves carved into a glass awning. Officially, the building is home to staff of China’s embassy in Washington. In 2015, a local blog documented its construction, mentioning Dingzihu, or “nail houses,” the homes in China that people refuse to let property developers demolish. But that’s not relevant to this complex, and what happened after embassy staff moved in has not been examined.

This resurgence of Cold War tactics includes bolstering the Russian embassy staff in Mexico City and disseminating propaganda through channels like RT.

					<p>Former UK intelligence chiefs Alex Younger and Jeremy Fleming recently suggested that the country’s three intelligence collection agencies should be seen as a capability, questioning whether they should even still be separate. Celia Parker-Vincent and Michael Goodman explain what might be lost in blurring or removing their distinct identities and suggest that finding a way to enable the closest possible working between the agencies is the key to facing today’s threats and ever-more complex operating environment. The UK should look to its Five Eyes partners, specifically the US and Australia, for inspiration. With one of the pre-eminent intelligence apparatuses in the world, the new UK government should make sure there is no risk to the country losing its strong position.

					<p>The authorised history of MI5 by Professor Christopher Andrew records the view of the late Professor Sir Michael Howard, founder of the King’s War Studies Department, that: "In Britain the activities of the intelligence and security services have always been regarded in the same light as marital sex.   Everyone knows that it goes on and is quite content that it should, but to speak, write or ask questions about it is regarded as bad form.  So far as official government policy is concerned, the British security and intelligence services, MI5 and MI6, do not exist.  Intelligence is brought by the storks and enemy agents are found under gooseberry bushes." I note that Michael Howard in that passage did not even dare to name GCHQ, the British signals intelligence and cybersecurity organization where I started my career in 1969. I was told when still at university about their fast stream cadet programme without being expected to know officially beforehand that GCHQ was an intelligence agency or even to know of the wartime existence and triumphs of Bletchley Park. There were almost no academic sources that I could have consulted to enlighten me. David Kahn had published in the US in 1966 his groundbreaking book, Codebreakers: The Story of Secret Writing but we now know that without his knowledge his publisher (Macmillan) had sent a copy of the draft to the US National Security Agency (NSA) who tried unsuccessfully to suppress it, but they did succeed – at GCHQ's insistence  – in removing references to NSA’s relationship with GCHQ as its long-term partner in UKUSA. Only during a briefing given to the small number of candidates who had survived the ordeal of the stiff GCHQ entry examination, just before the final interviews in the summer of 1969, were the veils of secrecy lifted, slowly one by one, with exhortations at each stage encouraging withdrawal if any of us were experiencing doubts about what we were learning of the real work of the organisation we were seeking to join.

					  <br>
					  Two trends are occurring simultaneously, and the marriage of these trends could significantly impact the terrorism threat landscape in both the short and long term. The first trend is that the barriers to entry have been lowered for individuals and small groups to engage with a range of emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence (AI). Not only are many AI services, including Large Language Models (LLMs) free or open-source, the intuitive user interfaces of many of these generative AI tools have made the use of certain AI/ML applications extremely accessible. There are myriad ways that terrorists and other extremists have, and will continue to, use AI for organizational and operational purposes, including: propaganda; interactive recruitment; automated attacks (e.g. unmanned aerial systems, or UAS); social media exploitation; and cyber attacks, to name just a few.</p>

					<p>‘Diversity, equity, and inclusion’ (DEI) initiatives have become widespread in the U.S. government, including the intelligence community (IC). Senior IC leaders claim that DEI policies improve the operational performance of agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency. This article criticizes these claims, shows them to be unsupported by evidence and simply skimpy, and goes further by briefly explaining how DEI policies damage the performance of U.S. intelligence agencies in five major ways. This study of the impact of DEI on a major component of U.S. national security establishment complements studies of the effects of DEI on businesses and universities.

					<p>The prospect of hanging, the eighteenth-century essayist and biographer Samuel Johnson wrote, wonderfully concentrates the mind.   So should the exploding pagers and walkie-talkies that blew through Hezbollah’s ranks in Lebanon two weeks ago. An attack by their web-enabled garage door opener or kitchen fridge, however, isn’t what should worry Americans.  Rather, it’s the country’s mounting vulnerabilities as their online personal information and activities—from texts, emails, and scrolling habits to wired homes, cars, and toys—transform their lives into an open book. Connecting remote controlled assassinations in Beirut and, say, a cosmetics marketer using social media posts to target ‘tweens’ in Buffalo isn’t an analytical stretch.  Surveillance, Harvard Business School’s Bruce Schneier wrote in 2014, is the business model of the internet.  Like the battlefield, in business its value lies in exploiting what you’ve found out.

					by Max Hastings<br>
					(Harper, 08 Oct 24)</p>
					<p>In February 1942, RAF intelligence was baffled by a newly identified radar network on the coast of Nazi-occupied Europe, codenamed Würzburg. British intelligence proposed an assault to capture key components. Incredibly brave agents of the French Resistance risked their lives to probe the German defenses on the Normandy coast. Then a company of Airborne forces were dropped into France in the dead of night amid heavy snow. Launching their attack, the allied soldiers dismantled the German’s radar, and after three nail-biting hours and a fierce battle with Wehrmacht defenders, escaped in the nick of time using landing-craft that carried them back across the stormy seas to Portsmouth. Operation Biting retells this dramatic operation through a gallery of amazing characters from Winston Churchill, who promoted the raid, to Lord Mountbatten, who commanded Combined Operations, to the brave unsung commandos who fought their way through enemy territory. A cliffhanger of a story that ratchets the suspense to the last page, Operation Biting sheds new light on an exciting and little-known chapter of the Second World War.</p>

					by Kim Conboy<br>
					(Barbrek Publishers, 03 Aug 21)</p>
					<p>During the Cold War, the Central Intelligence Agency’s biggest and longest paramilitary operation was in the tiny kingdom of Laos. Hundreds of advisors and support personnel trained and led guerrilla formations across the mountainous Laotian countryside, as well as running smaller road-watch and agent teams that stretched from the Ho Chi Minh Trail to the Chinese frontier. Added to this number were hundreds of contract personnel providing covert aviation services. It was dangerous work. On the Memorial Wall at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, nine stars are dedicated to officers who perished in Laos. On top of this are more than one hundred from propriety airlines killed in aviation mishaps between 1961 and 1973. Combined, this grim casualty figure is orders of magnitude larger than any other CIA paramilitary operation. But for the Foreign Intelligence officers at Langley, Laos was more than a paramilitary battleground. Because of its geographic location as a buffer state, as well as its trifurcated political structure, Laos was a unique Cold War melting pot. All three of the Lao political factions, including the communist Pathet Lao, had representation in Vientiane. The Soviet Union had an extremely active embassy in the capital, while the People’s Republic of China—though in the throes of the Cultural Revolution—had multiple diplomatic outposts across the kingdom. So, too, did both North and South Vietnam. All of this made Laos fertile ground for clandestine operations. This book comprehensively details the cloak-and-dagger side of the war in Laos for the first time, from agent recruitments to servicing dead-drops in Vientiane.</p>

				Addressing the theme directly will ensure a higher priority of acceptance, but manuscripts on other intelligence/national security-related topics will be considered. Please submit a simple Word Document, Times New Roman font (12-point text, 10-point notes). Citations can be footnotes or endnotes; double-spaced text; single spaced notes but double-spaced between entries; do not indent the first line of each paragraph of text, which should be formatted flush to the left margin.

For book reviews, publication dates should be no older than 2 years. Book reviews should be 800- 2,000 words; footnotes are not required or expected, but a few are acceptable. Longer reviews will be accepted if the reviewer can compare and contrast a new book with one or two other books on the same subject; these are considered "review essays," and will be listed as such in the table of contents.

				Sexism, misogyny and gender bias remain pervasive issues within the security sectors throughout the Indo-Pacific, undermining the effectiveness and equity of policing, intelligence and counter-terrorism efforts. Recent studies on women's roles  in the security sector have concluded that women face barriers due to institutional sexism and gender biases. Despite the critical roles women play, their contributions often go unrecognized, and they continue to be underrepresented in decision-making roles while facing systemic barriers that limit their participation and advancement. This special issue will highlight the need to investigate how gender impacts the logic and structures of thinking that shape practices, policymaking and knowledge-production within the security sector. We encourage the submission of scholarly research papers, as well as forum pieces (i.e., notes from the field, reviews, autobiographies, collective accounts and other forms of contemplation) on issues surrounding the preservation of gendered stereotypes, biases, and sexism within the security industries. We particularly encourage submissions from female early career researchers, established scholars and practitioners within the security sector from across the Indo-Pacific region that analyse these issues. Works submitted can have a theoretical, empirical, or practical focus.

				Africa is the second most populous continent. Unfortunately, this continent's intelligence community is one of the most underexamined. To fill this gap, this issue will explore any country within the continent's intelligence service and its relationship to the military, society, and external relations with partnerships with foreign governments, non-government organizations, and international organizations. The editors are particularly interested in submissions that focus on the intentionality of African governments and their security and intelligence services' efforts to redefine the nature and functions of institutions and the environment in which they operate. They are also interested in the nature and dynamics of non-state actor intelligence, including the role of sub-state actors and private security and intelligence entities.

Nations have engaged in spying for centuries, seeking to gain strategic advantages over their rivals by gathering crucial information on military capabilities, political intentions, and economic developments. Mr. Melton will take us on a journey of discovery from the roots of espionage in ancient civilizations like Egypt, China, and Rome to the medieval and Renaissance periods, through the emergence of code-breaking and secret communication techniques, and into the 20th century where major technological advances transformed espionage into a more sophisticated and organized enterprise. Your discovery of the world of intelligence rarely depicted in modern media does not have to stop at the end of the evening. The Hayden B. Peake Historical Intelligence Collection of over 10,000 publications documenting both historical and fictional accounts of intelligence from Elizabeth I to the present at the SCRC is available to researchers, scholars, and students.
